### Project Submission ###

For your submission, please submit the following:

A text file named urls.txt including:

Public Url to GitHub repository (not private) [URL01]

Note: The services should be up and running while the reviewer evaluates your project. If you use Udacity provided AWS account, the EC2 instance will shut down (not terminate) automatically after the session ends at every 4 hours. 

Therefore, you can consider rerunning the CircleCI pipeline just before the submission for provisioning the new AWS resources and provide the working URL02.
